# Firmware
## QMK and Vial
The design is a standard single board matrix with a RP2040 controller, so not much to write home about.

## Keymap/Layout
Thoughts:
- [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) layout.
  - Swap `;` with `'`.
  - Swap `/` for something else.
  - `,` returns `?` on hold.
  - `.` returns `!` on hold.
- Won't use traditional home row mods for GASC due to Colemak home row having common bigrams.
